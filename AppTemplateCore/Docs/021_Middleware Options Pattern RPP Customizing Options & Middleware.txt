1- Registering/Making Recognize the Token Provider to the Indentity Middleware.
Token Provider is the dependecy of Identity Middleware to work. 
We can use Default Token Provider with Default Options object
We can use Default Token Provider with Configured Options Object
We can use Customized Token Provider with Customized Options Options Object.

2- Using the Token Provider to configure the Identity Middleware. 
When Token Provider is instantiated, it uses the Default or Configured Options class 
to instantiate the Token Middleware.

3- Configuring the Options Class (Dependency) required by the Token Provider.

Token Generation is centralized in the Identity Framework.

When we configure the Centralized Options Object, this configuration is applied 
to all tokens generated by DataProtection Class. But we need to apply customzation to 
one token only. for this need CustomDataProtection and CustomOptions class

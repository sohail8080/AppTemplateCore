Don’t Forget About jQuery

In the midst of looking into JavaScript and JS frameworks 
you’ll also see mention of something called jQuery. 

jQuery might sound like another framework, 
but it’s actually considered a code library. 

Balachandran says that when she started working in development,
frameworks hadn’t yet come into their own 
and jQuery was considered the Swiss Army knife of JavaScript. 

Even today, that utility still stands. 
Where frameworks like Vue and React provide 
extensive templates to organize a website’s JavaScript code, 

they can be overkill if all you need is a quick solution to a specific JS coding problem. 
And that’s where jQuery comes in. 

The jQuery library is made up of JavaScript functions 
that can be accessed through a single line jQuery command 
(as opposed to the multiple lines of code it would take to perform the same functions by hand). 

jQuery can also be used to simplify JavaScript tasks like AJAX calls—
using JavaScript to communicate with a server and 
update parts of a website without users having to reload the entire page.

Unlike a framework, jQuery doesn’t provide a structured environment for your code 
(it simply provides shortcuts for individual functions), 
but—with a jQuery search bringing up over 13,000 job listings on Indeed 
at the time of this writing—
it’s still a critical skill to add to your JavaScript development toolkit.

The takeaway? Whether it’s a framework like 
Vue or 
React, or a library like 
jQuery, 

go ahead and start getting your hands on JS tools and 
seeing what you can do—
just as soon as you’ve established some foundational JavaScript knowledge. 

If you’re looking for places to start learning both JavaScript and JS frameworks, 
try dipping your toe into online tutorials from resources like 
Coursera and Udemy. 

And if you’re ready to take your JavaScript skills to the next level, 
consider paid, instructor-led classes from an online coding school like 
Skillcrush. 
Either way, getting started is your first key step.

=============================================


React.js
Ask a developer which JS framework to learn first and 
you’re likely to hear React.js mentioned in the same breath as 
Vue (even though React is technically a JavaScript library). 

In fact, it’s almost a toss up between the two—
while Vue may have surged in popularity recently, 
React has been at the top of the JS framework popularity charts for years now—
which means it comes with the benefits of industry-wide adoption, big company backing, 
and a large job market. 

According to programming Q&A forum Stack Overflow, 
jobs targeting developers with React skills rose over 150 percent 
on their job boards between 2015 and 2016. 

So, if you’re looking to work in front-end development with a speciality in JavaScript, 
you can see how you could do worse than starting off learning React.

Similar to Vue, React is designed for gradual implementation, 
meaning you can use as little or as much React on your website as your particular needs require. 
React can be added directly to HTML pages, 
after which it can be expanded throughout the page or limited to specific interactive widgets. 

Balachandran says that—like Vue—React has a relatively even learning curve 
and a supportive developer community. 
Vue may be edging out React as the framework darling of the moment in some quarters, 
but its strength in the job market makes it 
another worthy choice for a first framework to learn.

==============================

Vue.js
When I posed the question of which JS framework to learn first—
both internally to Skillcrush developers and externally to other JS pros—
Vue.js was consistently mentioned as a solid option. 

Although Vue was first released in 2014, 
its popularity has skyrocketed over the past couple of years. 

In 2017, Vue was “starred” by users 40,000 times (up from 26,000 in 2016) 
on the code hosting site GitHub, 
making it the site’s most popular JavaScript project category. 

With the second place framework on that list (React.js) coming in at 28,000 stars, 
you can get a sense of just how hot Vue is right now with developers. 

But what exactly is all the hubbub about?

According to Balachandran, Vue’s relative simplicity and gradual learning curve 
makes it a perfect starting framework for new JavaScript developers. 

Vue’s syntax 
(the set of rules defining which combinations of symbols 
make up properly structured code in a programming language) 
is HTML-based, allowing users to call upon their HTML knowledge 
to write pages 
(versus having to learn framework-specific languages 
when working with some framework options). 

A framework like Angular, for instance, 
requires learning a JavaScript variant called TypeScript, 
making it more of an unwieldy choice for beginners.

Still, Vue’s ease of use doesn’t mean it’s sitting at the kids table of JS frameworks. 
Balachandran says that—in addition to its beginner-friendly perks—
Vue is versatile enough to play as big or small a part in a website’s user interface layer 
(the parts of a site that a user interacts with through their browser) as you see fit. 

Vue templates can be written as HTML files or as JavaScript files, 
giving programmers options when it comes to how much of their site 
they want controlled by the framework—

Vue can produce a template for an entire website, 
part of one webpage, 
or all points in-between 
depending on how much of a site requires your own unique code. 

Finally, as an open source project with an enthusiastic user base, 
Balachandran says that Vue has a thriving peer community, 
making it a snap to find answers to your questions.

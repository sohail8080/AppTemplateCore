How to use Fiddler to test Web API

In this article, I am going to discuss how to use Fiddler to test Web API services.

What is Fiddler?
The Fiddler is a free debugging proxy tool 
which is used for testing restful web services. 
TESTING RESTFULL SERVICE 

COMPOSE MULTIPEL HTTP REQUEST
EXECUTE MULTIPLE HTTP REQUESTS

We can use Fiddler 
to compose and execute different HTTP requests to our Web API and 
check the HTTP response.

use Fiddler to send an HTTP request to our local ASP.NET Web API Services and 
check the response.

Step1: Download and install Fiddler from here.

Step2: Once the Fiddler is successfully installed, 
click on the Fiddler.exe to open Fiddler. 
It will look like the image shown below.

Fiddler by default captures all processes. 
But here we are not interested in all the processeS
we are only interested in capturing our local processes 
i.e. capturing the WEB API HTTP Resources. 

FIDDLER IS NOT A BROSWER PLUGIN, BUT IS IS SEPERATE DESKTOP SOFTWRAE
POSTMAN IS BROWSER PLUGIN FOR TESTING WEB API
FIDDLER IS DEKTOP APP FOR TESTING WEB API

So, click on the All Processes button which is at the bottom left corner and 
select Hide All as shown in the below image. 
Keep the focus on the Highlighted section.


In the next step, we need to click on the Composer tab. 
The first tab in the Composer tab is Parsed tab 

where we can configure the HTTP requests and execute it. 
CONFIGURE HTTP REQUEST AND EXECUTE IT

The first drop-down includes all HTTP Methods. 
Select a particular HTTP method for the request you want to execute. 

select the GET HTTP verb to execute HTTP GET request as shown below.

Please keep Focus on the selected section which is in Red Rectangle.

Now run the web API application and figure out the URL.

Enter URL and Execute: 
Now, we need to enter the URL of a request in the adjacent text box. 
Here, we will execute the HTTP request 
http://localhost:xxxx/api/values 


Response in Fiddler:
Once you enter the URL, 
click on the Execute button to send this HTTP request and 
it will immediately display the response in the left pane as shown in the below image.

Understanding Fiddler Request and Response:
Double click on the result row above 
(which is highlighted with the red rectangle) 
to open the Inspector tab for the request as shown below.

As you can see in the above image, 
the top panel shows the Request header and 
the bottom panel shows the response body.

Fiddler Request & Response in Raw Format:

You can also see the raw request header and response body 
by clicking on the Raw tab of request and 
response as shown in the image below.

This is the most preferable way in Fiddler to execute an HTTP request and 
checking the response. Let’s see how to make a post request using Fiddler.

Testing POST Request using Fiddler:

Select the Compose Tab,

Then choose the HTTP verb as POST: HTTP VERB

Set the Content-Type as application/JSON. CONTENT TYPE

In the request body, provide the string value that you want to add into the string array.
Click on the Execute button as shown below.

Testing PUT Request using Fiddler:

Select the Compose Tab,

Then choose the HTTP verb as PUT: HTTP VERB

In the URL provide the index of the array element whose value you want to update.

Set the Content-Type as application/json.

In the Request body, provide the updated string value 
that you want to update into the string array.

Finally, click on the Execute button as shown below.

Testing DELETE Request using Fiddler:

Select the Compose Tab,
Then choose the HTTP verb as DELETE
In the URL provide the index of the array element whose value you want to update.
Finally, click on the Execute button as shown below.

Here, in this article, I try to explain how to use Fiddler to test web API services.

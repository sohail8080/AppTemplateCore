WHY WE NEED ASP.NET WEB API
========================================
BECAUSE WE DO NOT WANT OUR WEB SERVER TO RETURN HTML
WE WANT CLIENT TO HAVE THIER OWN HTML
WE WANT TO SEPERATE DATA AND UI/HTML GENRATIN
WE WANT OUR DATA TO HAVE MULTIPLE CLIENTS
WE WANT BETTER INTEGRATION AMONG APPS
WEB SERVER WILL ONLY RETURN DATA.
THE WHOLE JOB OF RAZOR ENGINE & CONTROLLER WILL BE DONE BY THE 
JAVA SCIRPE ON THE CLIENT.
THAT IS WHY DIFFERENT JAVA SCRIPT FRAMEWORKS EMERGE
THAT MAKE IS EASY TO SHOW/POST/BIND JSON DATA ON THE CLIENT

TODAY WE DO NOT BUILD A SINGEL APPLICATION ON THE TOP OF OUR 
DATA SOURCE, WE BUILD MUTIPLE APPS ON THE TOP OF OUR DATA SORUCE
THAT IS WHY WEB APIS ARE THE SAFEST WAY AND THE FUTURE PROOF WAY 
TO BUILD THE APPS. 

WE DO NOT RESTRICT OURSELF TO THE SINGLE UI. 

WE KEEP THE UI OPTIONS OPEN AND FUTURE PROOF.

THAT IS WHY WE START OUR JOURNEY WITH WEB API
MULTIPLE APPS CAN BE BUILD ON IT.

IT ALSO STRICTLY DECOUPLES UI FORM THE MIDDLEWARE.

WE CAN CHANGE UI TECHNOLOGIES, JS FREWORKS WITHOUT 
CHANGING WHAT IS GOING ON SERVER.

UI AND BUSINESS LOGIC ARE SEPERATED AND BOTH CAN GROW INDEPENDELTY.

UI AND BUSINESS LOGIC HAVE DIFF CHANGING FACTORS AND THEREFOR 
THEY SHOULD BE SEPERATED, SO THAT THEY CAN GROW INDEPENDELY.

IN TODAYS WORLD, WEB API ARE THE SAFEST WAY TO GO.

IT IS ALSO SAFEST WAY TO GO FOR IN-HOUSE DEPLOYED WEB APPS
IT MAKE INTEGRATION EASY FOR SUCH APPS.

WEB APIS ARE SAFEST FOR WEB/INTER APPLICATIONS

WEB APIS ARE SAFEST FOR ENTERPRISE WEB APPS THOSE ARE DEPPLOYED IN 
THE PREMIESE OF ENTERPROSE

WEB API IS JUST A DOMAIN LOGIC WRAPPER ON THE TOP OF DATABASE. 
IT PROVIDES INTELLIGENT & SECURE DATA ACCESS STRATEGY

WEB API EXTENT THE DATABASE WITH SECURITY AND INTELLIGENCE

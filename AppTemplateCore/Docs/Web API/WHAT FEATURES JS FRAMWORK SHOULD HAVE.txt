AFTER RESTRICTING WEB SERVER TO PROVIDE DATA

WE NEED TO HANDLE ALL THE STUFF DONE BY RAZOR ENGINE ON THE 
CLIENT

JS IS THE LANGUAGE WITH WHICH WE CAN PLAY WITH JSON DATA ON THE 
CLIENT.

JS FRAMWORKS EMEMRGE TO MAKE THINGS EASY.


JS FRAMEWORK SHOULD HAVE FOLLOWING CAPABILITIES
AUTOMATIC DATA BINDING
===================================
IN CASE OF GET DATA, WE NEED 
DATA BINDING OF VARIABLES, ARRAYS & MODELS TO HTML CONTROLS


AUTOMATIC MODEL BINDING IN CASE OF POST
=================================================
IN CASE OF POST DATA, WE NEED 
MODEL BINDING OF VARIABLE, ARRAYS & MODELS BACK TO THE HTTP SEVICE 
PARAMETERS. WE NEED TO MAP THE POSTED DATA TO METHOD PARAMETERS


RESUABLE UI COMPONENTS/CONTROLS LIBRAIRES
=======================================
WE NEED REUSABLE, BINDABLE UI COMPONNETS ON THE CLIENTS.
WE GET JSON DATA, PROVIDE THAT DATA TO UI CONTROLS AND THEY 
RENDER THEMSELVES IN THE PAGE DOM.
WE HAVE CONTROLS LIBRARIS FOR ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET WEB FORMS. 
THESE CONTROLS ARE RESUABLE.


DATA VALIDATION
==========================================
WE NEED POWER DATA VALIDATION ON THE CLIENT SIDE. ASP.NET MVC DOES THIS
BY UNOBTURSIVE JS AND GENERATING THE ATTRIBUTES IN HTML MARKUP


TEMPLAGE ENGINE
=================================
WE NEED TEMPLATING LIKE RAZOR VIEWS IN THE HTML PAGE
WE JUST PASS MODEL TO THE HTML PAGE, AND PAGE RENDER ITSELF ON THE 
CLIENT. IT WAS DONE CLASSICAL ASP.NET WEB FORMS. 
IT IS DONE IN HTML HELPERS AND TAG HELPERS IN THE ASP.NET MVC


CONTROLLER FUNTIONALITY
=======================================
GET DIFF TYPESE OF REPONSES FROM THE WEB SERVER ALONG WITH DATA
AND ANALYZE THE DATA & RESPONSE AND RENDER THE HTML ACCORDINGLY


AJAX FUNCTINALITY
=====================================
CALLING THE REMOVE HTTP WEB SERVICES AND CAPABILITY TO HANDL AND 
INTERPRET THRE RESPONSE FROM THE WEB SERVER.


SEPERATION OF UI & UI PROCESSING LOGIC ON CLIENT
====================================================
HTML AND UI PROCESSING LOGIC IN JS SHOULD BE SEGREAGATED.
JS FRARMOWRK SHOULD PROVIDE THIS SEPEARTION MECHANIS
IN CLASSIC ASP.NET WEB FORM WE HAVE CODE BEHIND FILES
IN ASP.NET MVC, WE HAVE CONTROLLERS
IN ASP.NET RAZOR PAGE, WE HAVE CODE BEHIND FILES



ANGULAR, REACT, REDUX, DOJO, W3JS, Vue, Ember, Meteor, Backbone.js

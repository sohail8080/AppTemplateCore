CONFUSION ABOUT ROLES AND CLAIMS
=====================================

USERS ARE TAGGED WITH ROLES
THEY ARE STORED IN THE >>>USERSROLES TABLE
IF THAT TABLE HAS ENTRY FOR USER & ROLE, USER IS IN THAT ROLE
IT IS SIMPLE BOOLEAN RELATED TO THE ROLE.
ROLES ARE CLAIMS WITH BOOLEAN VALUE.

BUT CLAIMS ARE MORE OPEN ABOUT THEM. 
THE CAN STORE CLAIMS OF ANY DATA TYPE.
THERE IS A VALUE ATTACHED TO EACH CLAIM.
WE CAN STORED ROLES AS CLAIM IN THE USERS CLAIM TABLE
IN THIS CASE THE VALUE BECOME MEANING LESS.
IF FOR A USER, RECORD IS THERE, ROLE IS THERE FOR THE USER
IF FOR A USER, RECORD IS NOT THERE, ROLE IS NOT THERE FOR THE USER.
WE JUST LOOK THE PRESENCE OF RECORD IN THE USERCLAIMS TABLE
WE DO NOT LOOK AT THE VALUE. FOR BOOLEANS THAT IS OK.
FOR BOOLEAN IT IS OK THAT NAME VALUES COLUMS BOTH HAVE SAME VALUE
BECAUSE, THE BOOLEANS ARE NOT DECIDED ON VALUE OF CLAIMS THEY ARE
DECIDED ON WHETER WE HAVE RECORD IN TABLE OR NOT.
KUDVENKAT DOES THIS WITH CLAIMS. 

BUT IN ACTUAL, CLAIMS ARE NAME VALUE PAIR THOSE CAN HAVE ANY
DATA TYPE.

ALSO REMEMBER, WE CAN ADD USER PROFILE DATA IN THE CLAIMS AS WELL.
SO IF SOME CLAIMS DATA FITS WELL IN USER TABLE PUT IT THERE AND 
THEN ADD TO THE CLAIMS LIST, I HAVE DEFINED CLASS FOR THIS IN 
PROJECT AND HOOK THIS CLASS TO THE RPP.

THE USERCLAIMS TABLE HOLD INFO FOR THE CLAIMS THOSE ARE NOT THE 
PART OF USER PROFILE DATA. NOR THEY ARE THE ROLES. 

THESE ARE EXTRA PIECE OF NAME VALUE PAIR THAT IS USED FOR THE 
AUTHORIZATION AND DOES NOT FIT ANY WHERE.

===================================================

IN THE SAME WAY, WHEN APPLYING AUTHOIZATION CHECKS IN THE 
1- USER INTERFACE
2- CONTROLLER ACTIONS

WE CHECK BOTH
1- PRESENCE OF CLAIM INSIDE THE TABLE
2- WHAT IS THE VALUE FOR THAT CLAIM

=============================================================

IN THE SAME WAY

WHEN WE ADD CLAIMS
WE ADD RECORD WITH THE CLAIM VALUE

WHEN WE EDIT CLAIMS
WE EDIT RECORD WITH THE CLIAM VALUE

===============================================================

WHEN THE USER LOG IN, ALL ITS CLAIMS FROM TABLE ARE AUTO LOADED
AND INCLUDED IN THE CLAIMS LIST. WE DO TO THIS EXPLICITY AT THE 
USER LOG IN. IT IS DONE BEHIND THE SCENA AUTOMARICALLY.

======================================

FOR BOOLEAN CLAIMS, IT OK TO HAVE STATIC CLAIMS COLLECTION AS I AM 
DOING RIGHT NOW. RENDER IT USING THE CHECK BOX LIST, WHOLE LOGIC IS OK
FOR BOOLEAN CLAIMS. UI IS OK, CONTROLLER IS OK. CLAIMS STORE IS OK

FOR STRING/INT OTHER CLAIMS, DEFINE THE 
VIEW MODEL, 
UI, 
CLAIMSTYPE CONSTANTS

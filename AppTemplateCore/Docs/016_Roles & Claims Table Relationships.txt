There is a Many to Many Relation between 

1. User & Roles resolved by UserRoles table
2. User & Claims resolved by UserClaims table

When User is deleted, UserRoles & UserClaims entries should be deleted
but nothing should happens to Roles & Claims table. I Think this also OK

When UserRole and UserClaim mapping is deleted, nothing happens to 
the User, Roles & Claims tables. This thing is OK

Role should only be deleted if it has not entry in the UserRoles table
Claim should be removed from the Static Class if it has no entry in the 
UserClaim table
